TweetApp (working name ;)
===

TweetApp is a first, bad attempt at a command-line twitter interface that I would actually want (and like) to use. So far, I have found none that'd fit the bill.

That mythical, unlikely-to-ever-happen Twitter client was inspired by @garybernhardt and the example app, apparently-never-released Toot, used in [his talk on boundaries](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries). Of course, that app was Ruby, not Python, but whatever.
